 The MNFRepaymentAccount class encapsulates repayment account data in an object.
 
 A repayment account should not be directly initialized but instead should be constructed with data from the server.
 The response from the server will be automatically converted to an MNFRepaymentAccount object.
 
 A repayment account has two mutable properties, a name and account info.
